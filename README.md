Railway Track Anomaly Detection is a machine learning project aimed at enhancing railway safety by automatically identifying anomalies and faults in images of railway tracks. This repository contains the code for building, training, and evaluating a model capable of detecting anomalies on railway tracks using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques.



How It Works
Data Collection: The dataset used for this project comprises images of railway tracks, some of which contain anomalies or faults, while others are normal. These images are annotated to indicate the presence of an anomaly.

Transfer Learning: Transfer learning is employed using the MobileNet V3 architecture. MobileNet V3 is a convolutional neural network (CNN) pretrained on a large dataset and is capable of feature extraction from images.

Image Preprocessing: The input images undergo preprocessing and augmentation to improve the model's robustness. Techniques like rescaling, shearing, zooming, rotation, and flipping are applied to create a diverse training dataset.

Model Training: The MobileNet V3 model is fine-tuned using the annotated railway track images. The model is trained to classify images as either containing an anomaly or being normal.

Evaluation and Validation: The trained model is evaluated on separate validation and test sets to measure its performance. Metrics such as loss, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess the model's effectiveness.

Getting Started
